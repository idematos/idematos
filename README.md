# Hello, I'm [Isabela](https://dematos.dev).

I am an applied mathematician and computational scientist that has a strong interest in systems' energy consumption estimation and optimisation.
I write about computing, studies and philosophy on my [personal logbook](https://dematos.dev).

I also co-run the [Mogrene](https://mogrene.com) collective, where I work on building minimal websites and resource-sensitive tools.
