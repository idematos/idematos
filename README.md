# Hello, I'm [Isabela](https://dematos.dev).

I'm an applied mathematician with a strong interest in software energy consumption estimation and optimisation. At [Mogrene](https://mogrene.com), I work on building minimal websites and resource-sensitive tools.
Some of them are open-source and free to use (see [CSSential](https://cssential.mogrene.com)), others are turning into full-blown products to be launched on the near future (take a look at [Ecoloader](https://ecoloader.com)).

I also post some notes on studies and low-resolution photography in my [personal logbook](https://dematos.dev).
